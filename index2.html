                        Problem</label>
      <p>As former campers we have felt the disappointment of repeatedly not getting into our first choice of camp electives and as former staff members we understand the painstaking time and effort spent organizing these groups. There was never an easy
        way to make every camper happy when it came to putting them in groups based on their preferences.</p><label style="font-weight:bold">Our Solution</label>
      <p>Our unique software solution utilizes cutting edge mathematics to deliver an optimal solution to the group assignment problem based on input parameters. Our intuitive interface simplifies the complex mathematics behind the algorithms we use so that
        any staff member can use it. Our proprietary algorithm prioritizes campers that did not get their first choice in the previous assignment, ensuring all campers get a chance to be placed into their primary group. By using our product, camps can
        save the tremendous amount of time and effort spent on organization and instead spend it creating more memorable positive experiences for campers.
