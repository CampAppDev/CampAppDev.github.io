                      <p>As former campers we have felt the disappointment of repeatedly not getting into our first choice of camp electives
                          and as former staff members we understand the painstaking time and effort spent organizing these groups. There was
                          never an easy way to make every camper happy when it came to putting them in groups based on their preferences.
                      </p>
                      <label style="font-weight:bold">Our Solution</label>
                      <p>
                          Our unique software solution utilizes cutting edge mathematics to deliver an optimal solution to the 
                          group assignment problem based on input parameters. Our intuitive interface simplifies the complex 
                          mathematics behind the algorithms we use so that any staff member can use it. Our proprietary algorithm
                          prioritizes campers that did not get their first choice in the previous assignment, ensuring all campers get a chance to be placed 
                          into their primary group. By using our product, camps can save the tremendous amount of time and effort
                          spent on organization and instead spend it creating more memorable positive experiences for campers.

                    <h2>A program bank you'll never lose track of</h2>
                    <label style="text-weight:bold">The Problem</label>
                    <p>
                        In the summer of 2013, we developed a bullying program for our campers (a group of middle school boys)
                        who were constantly tormenting each other. The program was incredibly successful and the boys really 
                        connected in a way we had never seen them do before. While we all agreed that the program was effective, 
                        we had no way of passing it on to others for future use. When we wrote
                        the program, there was no way for us to see similar programs and look at what others had done and read
                        their own reflections on how the program went overall. Often, when a camp even has a program bank, it 
                        is a disorganized collection of papers and word documents that are impossible to sift through to find 
                        what you are looking for.
                    </p>
                    <label style="text-weight:bold">Our Solution</label>
                    <p>
                        Our programming bank models the activities in a way that makes it easy to document both old and new programs
                        at camp so that you'll never lose track of them. Future staff members can then retrieve old programs based on 
                        keywords and learn how to run the activity with little effort. All of this happens within our user-friendly
                        environment and all of your programs are backed up on our secure database. Each program within the database 
                        allows users to rate and comment on the program, so it's easy to give feedback that other users will be able
                        to see. This makes activities better and easier to run so that camper's can get the most out of them.
